  "text": " Elizabeth here. Just finished up at Maple Lane vet in Cork, spoke with Helen Riley. They've had three dental patients showing a tarte recurrence despite brushing. I talked about Dentahex oral rinse and left three trial bottles. She plans to try it on a couple of post-cleaning dogs. She mentioned wanting something easy for owners to use at home. Rinse fits perfectly. I'll follow up in a week.",
