  "text": " Nina here, just stepped out of East Park Vets in Limerick, met with Dr. Steve Brennan. They're seeing about eight senior dogs a week with mobility concerns. We discussed GallupRant, and I left five sample doses. He'll start with four patients and wants to compare outcomes with their current NSAI'd. Also asked for case studies if I have any. I'll send over a PDF today and check in next Thursday.",
