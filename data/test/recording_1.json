  "text": " Brian here, just left Wallace and Nash Veterinarian Galway, spoke with Dr. Lauren Conners. They've seen five cases of seasonal allergies and labs this week. I introduced Apaquel and left four starter tablets. She'll try them on two patients. She asked for a dosage chart, so I'll send that over tonight. She seemed pretty open. I'll circle back next Tuesday.",
