 Katie checking in. Just had a drop in at Brookside Animal Clinic, met Dr. Ethan Perez, clinics doing 40 vaccinations a week. We discussed VersaVac combo Vax. No samples today, but he's thinking of adding it to their puppy wellness plans, asked for the updated pricing sheet and wanted me to call back Friday once he talks to their head tech. Also, side note, they've got a new puppy mascot named Charlie.
