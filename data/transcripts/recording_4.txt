 Ricardo here, just dropped by Harborview Animal Hospital, talked to Luis Ortega. They've had two guinea pigs with dry skin this month. I introduced our gentle exotic shampoo and left one 100 milliliters sample. He'll try it during Friday's grooming sessions. He asked if we had small species-safe conditioners too. I told him I'd check and email details. Follow up in five days.
